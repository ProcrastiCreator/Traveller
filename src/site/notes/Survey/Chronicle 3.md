After arriving at [[Survey/Delta Quadrant/Lunion\|Lunion]] we decided to sell our illegal weapons. 

Jack found a really friendly broker called [[Contacts/Wayne Albach\|Wayne Albach]]. We met in a dark bar and he agreed to buy our military classed laser rifles for a really good price, because even if this seems to be a pretty "lawless" he seems eager to do business with ut. 

Since we are at a planet with a scoutbase we have acess to free fuel and able to move to district.

We got an invitation from another broker called [[Contacts/Johny Moora\|Johny Moora]]. Since we already made such good profit on our old cargo we suited up with new awesome looking [[Items/cloth\|cloth]] armour and new [[Items/Guns\|guns]] and visited him showing our best behaviour. 
That was probably good, because it showed up we where about to meet him in a very posh place so we all looked at Bilem on how to behave.  He knew (about) us because we had helped a Ke(p)ffler? with the Thingvillir? safariship. Therefor our names is out as competent travellers. 

He had some sensitive cargo wich he will pay us to move as efficient as possible to the planet of [[Pyramus\|Pyramus]] down in [[Trin's Veil\|Trin's Veil]].  The cargo is part of a charity-project called the [[Aramis project\|Aramis project]] and we are expected to pick up a couple of low birth crates with frozen Przewalski horses of Terran Sulemani stock. The stock has gone extinkt 6 times so they are extremely valuable.

**Therefore he offers to:** 
1. Charter the whole ship for 900 cr/ton/week (or 5000cr/cabin/week). 
2. Pay the basic personel 3,000/month on top of this offer. 

Since the cargo does not take up much space we can fill it up, as long as the cargo cant interfere with our efficient trip. 
The strangest thing is that this mission seemed legit to all of us. For real!

We need a Veterinarian with us to make sure the 20 ton compartment is taken care of all the way and especially wake them up and make sure they stay alive after they are woken up.
	2 adult mares
	2 inadult mares
	1 adult stallion
	1 juvenile stallion
**If** we deliver them alive we get a bonus of 5k/animal.
**If** they are healty for another month we get another 20k/animal.

We of course accepted this proposal without hesitating much, even though we all where hoping on staying on this sponsors good side.

To be able to do more jumps before refuelling we decided to buy an 40 tonnes inflatable fuel tank (Collapsable tanks) for 20k (wich leaves 98 tonnes for cargo). We are allowed to fill up the aditional space during the journey as long as it isnÂ´t risking the cargo to become slowed down unnessecary. 

**But** due to the value of the job we decided to go straight to the sponsor sir Tayce Gazishpa wich is responsible for the Artemis Project on Pyramus. [[Pyramus\|Pyramus]] is a small garden world wich she somehow seems to been able to shield from outside exploitation and the world is more or less described as an eden. 

We departured the first of july and jumped to 2225 where we refueled and did a sensor control of the empty space, just to jump further and arriving outside [[Strouden\|Strouden]] at the 21/7. We docked the [[scout base\|scout base]]  and filled up the tanks (22/7) before landing at the planet for trading (23/7). Back to orbit 24/7.

From [[Strouden\|Strouden]] we did a double jump again, refueling/scanning the emtpy space of [[2329\|2329]] (4/8) wich emptiness we scanned and left and arriving to [[Bicornn\|Bicornn]] the 18/8. While we where flying in towards the planet we where hailed by free trader [[Astral Spirit\|Astral Spirit]] who seems to think we are wasting our time there. We are not the ones to take good advices anyway so we continued to land on this Balkanized (balkan spread out on a small planet) system with a couple of hundred of thousands of people on a 0.6 gravity world. They just invented bookprinting and aint that fond of people carrying arms. We landed 19/8 and had to pay 300creds/ton unrefined fuel. Spent the 20/8 to trade and load stuff then left to orbit 21/8. 

Then we jumped from Bicorn the 22/8 just to arrive to [[2432\|2432]] the 28/8. We spend a week scanning refuelling for the jump to [[Burtson\|Burtson]] in wich orbit we arrived 14/9. Down 15/9, Trade 16/9, up to orbit 17/9. 

Then a jump to Squanine 18-25/9 directly using the exess fuel for the last jump to our last destination - the planet of [[Pyramus\|Pyramus]], where we arrived 5/10. We filled her up at the gas giant and started the departure down to the planet the 13/10. We where hailed and welcomed down to a quite big landing pad where we are about to land and exit the ship at the 14/10.

Pyramus is a small planet within the empire with enough water. Thousands of people. relaxed lawlevel. No concealed weapons (basically pistols and shotguns.)
